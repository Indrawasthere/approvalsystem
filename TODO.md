# TODO: Fix Dashboard Routing Issue

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Edit src/app/page.tsx to implement proper redirects based on authentication status
- [x] Verify src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx is correctly set up
- [x] Test the application to ensure login redirects to /dashboard successfully

## Progress
- Started: [Current Date/Time]
- Completed: Edited src/app/page.tsx to redirect authenticated users to /dashboard and unauthenticated to /login
- Verified: Dashboard page is correctly set up in src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx
- Fixed: Updated dashboard page to use consistent auth() function instead of getServerSession()
- Tested: Application is running on localhost:3000, root route redirects properly (307 status indicates redirect)
